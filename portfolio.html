        <p>Hello, my name is Suresh, and I am a third-year student at Adithya institute of management studies & Research. I am currently studying Bacheler of computer applications, with an emphasis on study on different hardware and software parts of computers.

            I have always had a passion for researching or knowing about computers with different specifications and how they are made?. Still, it wasn’t until the junior year that I began to take it seriously. In the past year or so, my concentration on researching has become more refined and polished. I have been able to apply what I’ve learned in school to help me learn more effectively and convey my ideas more clearly.
            
            My goal is to eventually be able to build Computer hardware and softwares marketing.</p>
